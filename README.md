# Router Log Monitor

The purpose of this project is to aid in the monitoring of logs generated by a Netgear R6400 router. I have configured to email its log every day at midnight.

Every once in a while I would find evidence of an unauthorized access to the WiFi access point. And not having time to look through logs every day I decided to automate the process.

## Overview

The primary components are:

* A Netgear R6400 router configured to email its logs.
* An email server, must be capable of IMAP.
* A LAMP stack server **located on your local network**. I'm using a NAS as my server. Something smaller like a Raspberry Pi B+ >=3 should also work.
* A web browser capable client on your local network.
